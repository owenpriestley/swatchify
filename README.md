# Swatchify

Have you ever wanted to redecorate your kitchen with a _Bat out of Hell_ colour scheme? Perhaps knit a scarf inspired by NWA's _Straight Outta Compton_? Well now you can!

Built in Node.js, Swatchify takes an album of your choice and gives you a corresponding colour palette. 

It's powered by [node-vibrant](https://github.com/akfish/node-vibrant/) and uses the Spotify API.
